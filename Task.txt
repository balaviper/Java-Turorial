IMPORTANT NOTE : The Output and the Input Should be exactly as the sample Output and Input
				 Even a extra space in Output will leads to Failure of test cases

Task 1 : 

    A train starts from A and stops at B. Speed of the train is 130km/hr.
    train stops at 5 stations, and waits 2 min in every stop.
    Distance between A and B is D(Get value from user).
	Calculate the time taken by the train to reach the destination.
     
	(Hint 1 : Use Scanner function to get input Distance)
	(Hint 2 : Think the logic of converting Hours to Minutes)

	Sample Input 1: 
	
	Enter the Distance : 
	780

	Sample Output 1:

	6 Hours 10 Min

	Sample Input 2: 

	Enter the Distance :
	970

	Sample Output 2:

	7 Hours 38 Min (approx)

Task 2 :

	Calculate Compound Interest :
	
	Formula  = P X (1 + R/100)^t (Use this Formula)
	
	Get all the following data and store it in respective data type variable
	And calculate the Final Amount A. 

	P	=	initial principal balance
	r	=	interest rate
	t	=	number of time periods elapsed

	(Hint 1 : If u need to do any power operation Use Math.pow() function)
	(Hint 2 : use printf and limit the decimal point by using %.2f)


	Sample Input :
	
	Enter the initial principal balance:
	50000

	Enter the interest rate:
	15.50

	Enter the time period:
	5

	Sample Output :

	Final Amount : 102773.21

Task 3:

	There are five college students. Declare an int array of size exactly [5].
	You have to get five student's age one by one and store it in the array.
	Check if the student's age which is in "3RD position" of the array is eligible for Voting.
	If yes print he is eligible for Voting. If no, Print not eligible.

	***IMPORTANT NOTE : USE ONLY CONDITIONAL OPERATOR inside print statement to validate age.***

	Sample Input 1 :

	Enter the age of the Students :
	17
	16
	19
	17
	20

	Sample Output 1 :

	The third student is eligible for voting.

	(Explanation : Third student's age is 19. Which is greater than 18 so he is eligible.)

	Sample Input 2 :

	Enter the age of the Students :
	16
	18
	15
	17
	21

	Sample Output 2 :

	The third student is not eligible for voting.
