IMPORTANT NOTE : The Output and the Input Should be exactly as the sample Output and Input
				 Even a extra space in Output will leads to Failure of test cases

Task 1 : 

    A train starts from A and stops at B. Speed of the train is 130km/hr.
    train stops at 5 stations, and waits 2 min in every stop.
    Distance between A and B is D(Get value from user).
	Calculate the time taken by the train to reach the destination.
     
	(Hint 1 : Use Scanner function to get input Distance)
	(Hint 2 : Think the logic of converting Hours to Minutes)

	Sample Input 1: 
	
	Enter the Distance : 
	780

	Sample Output 1:

	6 Hours 10 Min

	Sample Input 2: 

	Enter the Distance :
	970

	Sample Output 2:

	7 Hours 37 Min

Task 2 :

	Calculate Compound Interest :
	
	(If u dont know the Formula Search it in google)
	
	Get all the following data and store it in respective data type variable
	And calculate the Final Amount A. 

	P	=	initial principal balance
	r	=	interest rate
	n	=	number of times interest applied per time period
	t	=	number of time periods elapsed

	(Hint 1 : If u need to do any power operation Use Math.pow() function)
	(Hint 2 : use printf and limit the decimal point by using %.2f)


	Sample Input :
	
	Enter the initial principal balance:
	50000

	Enter the interest rate:
	15.50
	
	Enter the number of times interest applied
	2

	Enter the time period:
	5

	Sample Output :

	Final Amount : 211266.65
