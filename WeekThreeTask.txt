Task 1 : 

    Given : A string s and int k
        * S is one word String and k refers to the length of substring
        * Find all substrings with given substring length of the given string s.
        * Then print the smallest and largest strings on comparing the substrings in Lexicographical Order

        (Hint : Lexicographical order is : A < B < C eg : car < cat , dog < horse < bac < dam)
        (Hint 2 : there is a function to compare strings lexicographically, find it(not able to find as me in whatsapp))

        Input Format
            The first line contains a string denoting s.
            The second line contains an integer denoting k.

        Sample Input : 
            welcometojava
            3    

        Sample Output : 
            ava
            wel

    Explanation : 

        String s = "welcometojava" has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length : k = 3 

        "ava", "com", "elc", "eto", "jav", "lco", "met", "oja", "ome", "toj", "wel"

        smallest = "ava" and largest = "wel"
