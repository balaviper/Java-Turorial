Task 1 : 

        Ravi bought a new car, now he want to choose a register number plate for his car.
        Ravi likes Prime Numbers very much, so he wants to choose his number as
        the sum of all the digits in the number plate should be a factor of prime number.
        Write a program which gives the count of lucky numbers in the given list of numbers.

        (Hint 0 : Create two BOOLEAN function isLucky(int num) and isPrime(int num) which should return true or false)
        (Hint 1 : use while loop, arrays, arithmatic operators to make program easy)


        Sample Input 1 :

            Request No of numbers you want to check :
            5

            Enter 5 elements to check for lucky :
            2468
            3143
            1042
            2313
            6128

        Sample Output 1 :

            Count of lucky numbers : 3


    Explanation : 

    Sum of digits in 2468 : 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20 => not a prime number
    Sum of digits in 3143 : 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 11 => is a prime number
    Sum of digits in 1042 : 1 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 7 => is a prime number
    Sum of digits in 2313 : 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 9 => not a prime number
    Sum of digits in 6128 : 6 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 17 => is a prime number

    So, total prime count is 3 

    Sample Input 2 :

            Request No of numbers you want to check :
            3

            Enter 3 elements to check for lucky :
            2405
            1111
            1211
            

        Sample Output 2 :

            Count of lucky numbers : 2
